# train_scheduler
Train Scheduler moment.js &amp; firebase exercise.
In this application we define a train schedule based on current time and the frequency of the train, and display the next arrival and time to arrival. Values are stored in firebase and appended to a table on the html page. The Clear All funciton removes all data from the html page as well as the database.
